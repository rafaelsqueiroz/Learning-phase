# Learning-phase
This repository represents my start in programming.
As a mechanical engineeer I never felt the need of programming. I could solve most of the problems with excel. However, I'm now acting in the field of robotics and therefore need the develop this skill. 
The content of this repository is quite simple: basically some programs from the course "Aulas Python" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJjR906426o&list=PLfCKf0-awunOu2WyLe2pSD2fXUo795xRe) and some others that I created myself in order to learn.

Update  April.2020: new scripts and exercises based on the online course "Formação Cientista de Dados com Python e R" (https://www.udemy.com/course/cientista-de-dados/)
